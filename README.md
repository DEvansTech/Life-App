# life-app-RN

Created Using the Expo Typescript [Template](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/). Includes [Tailwind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for styling.

## Configuration

Expo makes configuration easy. To run the app:

```bash
git clone...
yarn
yarn run start
```
This will fire up the expo SDK and you can choose which platform you want to run from there. You also have the option to run it on a physical device if you have the Expo Go app installed on your phone. Scan the QR code after starting the SDK and you will be running it through Expo Go.

Alternatively, you can run

`yarn run ios` or 
`yarn run android`

to run either emulator.
